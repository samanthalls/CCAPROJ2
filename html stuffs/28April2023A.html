                <div class="p1">Most animes are great, but they turn bad when you use a bad anime website. 
                    Since most anime websites are free most of them are pirated as well.
                    So if you use an old anime website it is probably already banned.
                    This website will be talking about the best anime websites that are still working, and best animes too.
