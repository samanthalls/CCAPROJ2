                <div class="p1">Most animes are great, but they turn bad quality when you use a bad anime website. 
                    Since most anime websites are free most of them are pirated as well.
                    So if you use an old anime website it is probably already banned.
                    This website will be talking about the best anime websites that are still working, and best animes too.
                    Manga is usually drawn by one person while the anime counterpart is a lot of workers making them for higher quality.
                    Most animes have thin lines while mangas have bold ones as the usual artstyles. Check <a href="../html stuffs/music.html">images</a> for anime/manga artstyles.
                    Also, a lot of animes have gret soundtracks and songs, but only a few are actually on this website. Sorry. To hear some of these songs go to <a href="../html stuffs/music.html">music</a>.
                    If you want to see the list of anime/manga websites (sorry its a small list) go to <a href="../html stuffs/list.HTML">list</a>.

                <p>Purely funfacts about animes/mangas! The first anime was released in 1916-1917.
                    CGI type animes used to be hated but now are more watched because of Chainsaw Man, Land of the Lustrous, and more.
                    Netflix's original animes have a lot of CGI type animes.
